- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Thanh but just call me Fin. I'm currently in my second year at Swinburne University studying Computer Science. I like building awesome and 
cool interfaces. I have been spending some time learning React, Redux and Typescript. 
Check out my current project via Repo. 

## Updated 22/11/2021: Currently I challenge myself to build a small UI feature using ReactJS and CSS to keep my skills updated. View projects via repository.
